*Courses on Software.*

* [Introduction to Linux (The Linux Foundation)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/) - More important than diving into a course on software engineering in Python, C/C++ or Java, its better to get started with an introduction to Linux on which powers the servers of the world. Bash shell scripting will go a long way for a programmer/computer scientist.

* [CS188.1x: Artificial Intelligence (Berkeley: Dan Klein and Pieter Abbeel)](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-cs188-1x-artificial-intelligence-445) - An excellent introduction to AI that should be the foundation for any AI education. Instead of overly focusing on Deep Learning, it covers the broader domain of AI technologies and fundamentals which sets up a better understanding of AI. Coursework is very well done too.

* BERT
    * [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (Jacob Devlin)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/seminar/details/jdevlin.pdf) - A set of slides explaining BERT by the author himself.
    * [BERT Explained: State of the art language model for NLP](https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270) - A medium blog post explaining BERT. It's either the first of second on a Google search so you know it's pitched at a good level to read.
    * [A Primer in BERTology: What we know about how BERT works](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12327v1.pdf) - Anna Rogers, Olga Kovaleva, Anna Rumshisky (2020). A Primer in BERTology: What we know about how BERT works. arXiv. A later and more deep technical study of BERT.
